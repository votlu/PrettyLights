# PrettyLights

Some examples of using the Adafruit NeoPixel libraries to make pretty lights

The examples require you use a 14x14 board, if you want to use your own resolution you'll have to do some modifications. (`strip` variable initialization, designs, etc.). The maple leaf example's pixel art is 14x14 so add padding to the `lights` array or make your own sick design.
